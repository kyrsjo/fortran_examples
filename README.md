fortran_examples
================

Some examples for FORTRAN programming, currently fixed form compilable with gfortran. Meant as a learning tool.

Much of it is inspired by
http://en.wikibooks.org/wiki/Fortran (slightly incomplete)
and
http://de.wikibooks.org/wiki/Fortran (very good, but in German)
